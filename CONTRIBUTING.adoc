== Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[code of conduct].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to yaktor@scispike.com.

[[quickstart]]
== Quickstart

For the impatient, if you want to submit a quick pull request:

* Make sure there is a ticket in the bug tracker for the project.
* Make sure you format source correctly, and don't submit only formatting-related changes.
** For JavaScript code, make sure to format with https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard[the npm "standard" module].
** For Java, make sure you use the code formatters provided https://github.com/SciSpike/build-support/tree/master/etc/ide[here] and have them applied to your changes.
* Make sure you submit test cases (unit or integration tests) that back your changes.
* Try to reuse existing test sample code. Try not to amend existing test cases but create new ones dedicated to the changes you're making to the codebase. Try to test as locally as possible but potentially also add integration tests.
* In the doc for the newly added test cases refer to the ticket the changes apply to like this
* Make sure you added yourself as author in the headers of the files you touched. Amend the date range in the Apache license header if needed. For new files, add the license header (copy from another file and set the current year only).
* The commit message should follow the following style:
** First line starts with the ticket id.
** Separate ticket id and summary with a dash.
** Finish summary with a dot.
** In the description, don't use single line breaks -- no manual wrapping. Separate paragraphs by a blank line.
** Add related references at the very bottom (also see the section on pull requests below).
* Make sure you provide your full name and an email address registered with your GitHub account. If you're a first-time submitter, make sure you have completed the https://github.com/SciSpike/build-suport/master/legal/icla/SciSpike-ICLA.txt[Individual Contributor License Agreement form].

[[advanced]]
== Advanced

This section contains some advanced information, mainly targeted at developers of the individual projects.

[[advanced.general]]
=== General

* Fix bugs in master first.  If it's reasonable to port the fix back into a maintenance branch, try to do so by cherry picking.
* Try to keep the lifespan of a feature branch as short as possible. For simple bug fixes, they should only be used for code review in pull requests.
* On longer running feature branches, don't pull changes that were made to master in the meantime. Instead, rebase the feature branch onto current master, sorting out issues and making sure the branch will fast-forward merge eventually.

[[advanced.change-tracking]]
=== Change tracking

* Make sure you don't commit without referring to an issue. If we have a rather general task to work on, create an issue for it and commit against that one.
* Try to resolve an issue in a single commit. I.e., don't have separate commits for the fix and the test cases. When polishing pull requests requires some more effort, have a separate commit to clearly document the polishing (and attribute the efforts to you).
* We usually use feature branches to work on issues and potentially let multiple people work on a feature. For Java projects, there's a https://github.com/SciSpike/build-support/tree/master/etc/scripts/java/new-issue-branch[new-issue-branch script] available that sets up a feature branch for you, and adds a commit changing the Maven version numbers so that the branch builds can still publish snapshot artifacts but don't interfere with each other. We'll add a scirpt for Node.js projects soon.
* Follow the commit message style described in <<quickstart>>. Especially the summary line should adhere to the style documented there.
* After pushing fixes to the remote repository, mark the issue as closed.
* Avoid merge commits as they just tend to make it hard to understand what comes from where. Using the issue identifier in the summary line will allow us to keep track of commits belonging together.

[[advanced.code-style]]
=== Code style

This section contains some stuff that the IDE formatters do not enforce. Try to keep track of those as well

* Eclipse users should activate Save Actions to format sources on save

=== Handling pull requests

* Be polite. It might be the first time someone contributes to an OpenSource project so we should forgive violations to the contribution guidelines. Use some gut feeling to find out in how far it makes sense to ask the reporter to fix stuff or just go ahead and add a polishing commit yourself.
* The information we need from contributors are: their full name, an email address they have associated with their Github account, their ICLA (for the first contribution). Especially the first one probably needs to be asked for as people sometimes just use some alias in their GitHub account.
* If you decide to merge stuff back make sure that all the infrastructure requirements are met.
* Before merging stuff back into master, make sure you rebase the branch. We generally do not allow merge commits, so a merge should always be fast-forward.
* The simplest way to merge back a pull request submitted by someone external is curl-ing the patch into `git am`. You can then polish it by either adding a commit or amending the provided commit. Make sure you keep the original author when amending.

* If the you merge back a feature branch and multiple developers contributed to that, try to rearrange to commits and squash the into a single commit per developer. Combine the commit messages and edit them to make sense.
* Before pushing the changes to the remote repository, amend the commit(s) to be pushed and add a reference to the pull request to them. This will cause the pull request UI in GitHub show and link those commits.
